            <ul>
                <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
                <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
                <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
                <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, 
                    <span class="highlight">in this tutorial we will use inline <br> and internal styles,</span>
                    because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself

        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
        ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to<br>
        link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p style="color: brown;">
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,
        a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p style="color: brown;">
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements 
        to which a style should be applied.
